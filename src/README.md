# Welcome to SpaceApp! 

### SpaceApp provides a hub of space information, including information direct from NASA.

## What's Changed

- The old SpaceApp repository has been set to private, and this will be the working repository for the project moving forward.

- You may notice that the repository has grown substantially in size. This is because I have
migrated the project into the Ionic Angular framework. This will allow me to scale features and create new pages 
much easier. The original APOD page functionality works, and I am working on two additional pages currently.


## Current Features:

- Daily Space Picture: 
    Check out an image of space, directly from NASA's archives! 
    Search for any date and the appropriate APOD will display.

## What's Next
- Mars Weather Dashboard
    View weekly updates on Martian Weather.

- Exoplanet Dashboard
    A summary of data collected by NASA on the most recent planet discoveries.


### Known Issues
    -I've noticed during development that the web browser cache doesn't clear sometimes. I'm currently working
    on a fix but in the mean time if there is an issue, try resetting the browser cache (ctrl + shift + r)
